## ShareChat/Moj, Bangalore

### Graphics Engineer (SDE-1) [November'22 - February'23]

***ðŸ‘¾ Shutter 3D Graphics Library:*** 
- Graphics Debugger: Implemented graphics debugger UI for the mobile first graphics engine using ImGUI.
- 2D/3D lenses(Filters): Understood the implementation of 2D/3D lenses(filters) for live camera system.
-  Worked on the Layered UI Architecture for the graphics debugger, which allowed for UI layers to be added or
removed dynamically on the live camera system and could be scaled to cross graphics platforms.
- Explored the cross-platform implementation of the graphics engine used to render complex graphics on
multiple platforms.
